# Getting started
Rew has not yet really been released for all platforms, but you can install it on your system like so.


## Windows
Well, you can either download [this](https://github.com/kevinj045/rew/releases/latest/download/rew.exe) and put it in your path or just run this as administrator:
```bash
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevinj045/rew/main/install-windows.ps1 | iex
```

## MacOS
Well, macos huh, never really used it apart for random little tasks i had to do on other people's computers at desperate times. But i hope [the dmg in the releases](https://github.com/kevinj045/rew/releases/latest) works for you. If anything happens and it doesn't work, or if u wanna help out, either contact me or post an issue at [the github repo](https://github.com/kevinj045/rew).

## Linux
Okay, you'd expect me to have released it for every distro out there, and i will over time, but for now, here's what to do:

## Most linux distros
On most linux distros, this should work:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevinj045/rew/main/install-rew.sh | bash
```
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevinj045/rew.pimmy/main/install-rew.sh) is the script if you want to read it before you run it (which i highly advice).

## Nix systems
On nix systems there is a flake for it, so you can always setup the flake, but like- even if you input it rn, it's not setup to do anything really.
