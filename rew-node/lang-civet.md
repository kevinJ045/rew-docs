# Rew with Civet
::: info Notice
Rew version **1.2.57** has now support for [civet](https://civet.dev/).
:::
Using [civet](https://civet.dev/) files on top of `rew` allows you to declare and use civet types and more all inside of your previous coffeescript code. Civet allows for typescript types and more typescript features, all while allowing you the luxery of doing it in a coffee like syntax. 

## What is Civet?
Civet is a modern syntax layer for JavaScript that adds TypeScript types and other advanced JavaScript features to CoffeeScript-like syntax. It allows you to write code that is both elegant and type-safe, bridging the gap between CoffeeScript’s simplicity and TypeScript’s robustness.

## Using Civet
To use civet, just name your files `.civet`. And just like [coffee files](/lang-coffee#using-coffee-files) you can use and import your `.civet` files directly inside of your `.coffee` files or you can just use `.civet` files and run them

## Rew's syntaxes and Civet
[Rew's special syntaxes](/lang-coffee#special-rew-syntaxes) and compiler annotations still work in civet just how you would expect them in you [coffee files](/lang-coffee);
