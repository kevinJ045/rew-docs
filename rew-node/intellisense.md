# Rew and Intellisense
Rew, while using **CoffeeScript** also has it's own [context](/context.html). Making it difficult to use the convetional intellisense. 

So to use intellisense, you can either run the `rew misc types .` command or enable types when you create a project. 

Once you loaded that, it should work if you have a coffeescript LSP plugin that translates your coffeescript into clean js.

## Rew's Intellisense Option
By default, when creating a project with rew, it asks you if you want to use intellisense or not, which will create the necessary files by default.
