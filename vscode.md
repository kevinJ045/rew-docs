# Intellisense on VSCode
For vscode, there is an extension called **CoffeeSense** it helps with intellisense for your coffeescript files. 

You can see about it [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=phil294.coffeesense&ssr=false).

Or install it with:
```bash
ext install phil294.coffeesense
```

Once you have installed it, if your project has the `jsconfig.json` and `runtime.d.ts`, you can use intellisense with rew's runtime.
